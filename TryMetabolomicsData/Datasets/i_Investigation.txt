Study Title	Targeted plasma metabolomics combined with machine learning for the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2
Study Description	<p>The routine clinical diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is largely restricted to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and tests that detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen. Given the diagnostic delay and suboptimal sensitivity associated with these respective methods, alternative diagnostic strategies are needed for acute infection. We studied the use of a clinically validated liquid chromatography triple quadrupole method (LC/MS-MS) for detection of amino acids from plasma specimens. We applied machine learning models to distinguish between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative samples and analyzed amino acid feature importance. A total of 200 samples were tested, including 70 from individuals with COVID-19, and 130 from negative controls. The top performing model overall allowed discrimination between SARS-CoV-2-positive and negative control samples with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91, 1.00), overall sensitivity of 0.99 (95%CI 0.92, 1.00), and specificity of 0.92 (95%CI 0.85, 0.95). This approach holds potential as an alternative to existing methods for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.&nbsp;</p>

Study Protocol Description	<p>Individuals with RT-qPCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from a respiratory sample (nasopharyngeal, nasal, or oropharyngeal) were identified. Participants were selected from 2 academic tertiary care hospitals (Stanford Health Care [SHC] and Lucille Packard Children’s Hospital [LPCH]) and affiliated clinics and outpatient centers in the Bay Area, from March 2020 to November 2020. SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed as previously described, using an in-house emergency use authorization (EUA) real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), or 1 of 2 commercial SARS-CoV-2 assays, the Panther Fusion or TMA (Hologic, Malborough, MA)<strong>[1]</strong>. Residual plasma specimens were obtained from individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and used for plasma metabolomics testing. Only plasma samples collected within 7 d of the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection were included to include acute COVID-19, and there was no additional selection based on cycle threshold (Ct) value or clinical severity. In addition, we identified individuals to serve as negative controls from the following groups: pooled donor blood negative for SARS-CoV-2, hospitalized individuals and outpatients with residual plasma from EBV or CMV viral load testing, hospitalized individuals with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and/or procalcitonin (PCT) and without SARS-CoV-2 infection, and symptomatic individuals with a confirmed respiratory viral infection other than SARS-CoV-2. For the latter group, respiratory viral testing was performed on the ePlex Respiratory Pathogen (RP) panel (GenMark Diagnostics, Carlsbad, CA) at the Stanford Clinical Virology Laboratory. Given that plasma is not a routinely collected specimen for the diagnosis of COVID-19, we enrolled eligible individuals without matching for age and sex between the positive and negative groups. Plasma procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were measured on a Roche Cobas e801 and c702 modules, respectively, (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Ref:</strong></p><p><strong>[1]</strong> Food and Drug Administration.
